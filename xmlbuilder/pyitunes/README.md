**Before using pyItunes it is recommended that you backup your Itunes Library XML file. Use pyItunes at your own risk - there is no guarantee that it works or will not blow-up your computer!**

## Usage:

```
from pyItunes import *

l = Library("iTunes Music Library.xml")

for id, song in l.songs.items():
	if song.rating > 80:
		print song.name

playlists=l.getPlaylistNames()

for song in l.getPlaylist(playlists[0]).tracks:
	print "[%d] %s - %s" % (song.number, song.artist, song.name)
```

See below for available song attributes.

There is also a deprecated legacy method, which still works for now:

```
from pyItunes import *

pl = XMLLibraryParser("iTunes Music Library.xml")
l = Library(pl.dictionary)

for song in l.songs:
	if song.rating > 80:
		print song.name
```


## Notes

Track counts may not match those shown in iTunes. e.g.:

```
l = Library("iTunes Music Library.xml")
len(l.songs)
```

May report a higher number than the song count shown in iTunes itself. This is because
iTunes does not count things like Podcasts and Voice Memos as "Music," whereas
pyitunes counts **all** tracks.

Version 0.2 adds the ability to get playlists. However, the songs dictionary is keyed on TrackID (as coded in iTunes xml).
